# GitHub Activity Processing

## Current Implementation

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface GitHubActivity {
  timeWindow: {
    start: Date;
    end: Date;
  };
  repositories: {
    [repoFullName: string]: {
      totalCommits: number;
      organization?: string;
      commits: {
        message: string;
        timestamp: Date;
        sha: string;
      }[];
      summary?: string; // Repo-specific summary
    };
  };
  organizations: {
    [orgName: string]: {
      totalCommits: number;
      repositories: string[]; // repo full names
      summary?: string; // Org-specific summary
    };
  };
  overallSummary?: string; // Summary across all activity
}
```

### Core Features

1. **Time Window Processing**

   - Dynamic window based on days parameter (default: 7 days)
   - Flexible for any time period
   - Used for filtering and grouping activity

2. **Event Processing**

   - Currently focusing on PushEvents only
   - Extracts commit information:
     - Messages
     - Timestamps
     - Repository context
     - Organization context

3. **Summary Generation**

   - High-level, feature-focused summaries
   - Aggregates related commits into meaningful descriptions
   - Example:

     ```
     Raw Commits:
     - "fix: user deletion validation"
     - "feat: add user deletion API"
     - "test: user deletion scenarios"

     Generated Summary:
     "Implemented user deletion functionality with validation and testing"
     ```

4. **Access Control**
   - Uses provided GitHub token for authentication
   - Accesses both public and private repositories
   - Access level determined by token permissions

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Event Types

- Pull Request Events
- Issue Events
- Review Events
- Discussion Events

### Extended Metrics

These would require additional API calls:

- Lines of code changed
- File changes
- Impact analysis
- Contribution patterns

### Advanced Analytics

- Commit frequency patterns
- Activity heat maps
- Collaboration insights
- Project velocity metrics

### Performance Considerations

- Caching strategies for repeated queries
- Rate limit management
- Batch processing for large time windows

## Implementation Notes

### API Limitations

- GitHub API rate limits
- Event history limitations
- Data freshness considerations

### Best Practices

1. Error Handling

   - Rate limit exceeded
   - Invalid tokens
   - Network failures
   - Missing data

2. Data Processing

   - Deduplication of events
   - Proper time zone handling
   - Data validation

3. Summary Generation
   - Context awareness
   - Meaningful aggregation
   - Clear and concise output

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Basic usage
const activity = await githubClient.getActivitySummary({
  days: 7,
  username: 'user123',
});

// Custom time window
const activity = await githubClient.getActivitySummary({
  days: 30,
  username: 'user123',
});
```

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests

   - Time window calculations
   - Event processing
   - Summary generation

2. Integration Tests

   - API interaction
   - Data aggregation
   - End-to-end flows

3. Mock Data
   - Sample events
   - Various time periods
   - Different activity patterns
